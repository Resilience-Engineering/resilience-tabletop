## Resilience Tabletop

This repository is an expansion of the research and presentation run by Dr. Laura Maguire and Courtney Nash at SRECon 2024 titled [Hard Choices, Tight Timelines: A Closer Look at Skip-Level Tradeoff Decisions during Incidents](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon24americas/presentation/maguire). The discussion used a vignette written with some extra help from Fred Hebert, and following feedback from the presentation and study participants, the exercise has slowly turned into a tabletop exercise.

We are providing this little interview toolkit as a way to facilitate hypothetical but realistic scenarios.

### How to use this?

Two main documents are currently written:

- [the vignette](scenario/vignette.md), a scenario in three parts discussing an organization-wide set of escalating incidents that aims to challenge decision-making tradeoffs
- [the facilitation guide](facilitation/guide.md), a set of high-level instructions for people wanting to run the scenario.

This latter document contains information we think might be useful for people wanting to run the scenario on their own.

### Feedback Requested

While we are distributing this set of documents for free and for people to try it within their organizations, the original authors do maintain full copyright (this is **not** a Creative Commons licensed document).

In terms of payment, we would like to request feedback about the experiments you have run. Consider [filling in our survey's questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-LK10oIl2lVjFnX2QzeipiXvC8BY_nN2JJbXelglx12yDBQ/viewform?usp=sf_link), which will in turn let us improve this toolkit and expand its use.
